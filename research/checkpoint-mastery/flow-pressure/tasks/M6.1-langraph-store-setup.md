# Task 6.1: [Integration] LangGraph Store Setup

## The Constraint

**Before:** Knowledge isolated per thread → no cross-thread learning
**After:** LangGraph Store enables cross-thread knowledge sharing

---

## The Witness

**Observable Truth:** Store namespaces created, put/get/search operations work

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Store configured with PostgreSQL backend
- [ ] Namespaces created (user_preferences, learned_facts, shared_knowledge)
- [ ] Put operation stores data successfully
- [ ] Get operation retrieves data by key
- [ ] Search operation finds data by similarity

---

## Code Pattern

```python
from langgraph.store.postgres import PostgresStore

# Create store (shares PostgreSQL with checkpoints)
store = PostgresStore(
    conn_string="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/checkpoints"
)
await store.setup()

# Store operations
# Put
await store.put(
    namespace=["user_preferences", "user-123"],
    key="theme",
    value={"color": "dark", "font": "large"}
)

# Get
pref = await store.get(
    namespace=["user_preferences", "user-123"],
    key="theme"
)

# Search
results = await store.search(
    namespace=["learned_facts"],
    query="Paris is the capital"
)
```

---

## The Completion Signal

**Signal:** Store operations (put/get/search) working, namespaces created

**Evidence:** Store table exists, operations tested

---

## Notes

**Store vs Checkpoints:** Checkpoints = thread state (temporal). Store = persistent facts (timeless).

**Namespace Strategy:** Organize by data type (preferences, facts, knowledge). Enables efficient queries.
