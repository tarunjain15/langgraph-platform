# Phase 7: Production Mastery - Task Summary

## The Sacred Truth

**Automation + optimization unlock production mastery.**

M7.1 removes manual scaling. M7.2 removes cost waste. M7.3 removes blind spots. Together: autonomous, cost-optimized, fully observable production system.

---

## Task Execution Order

```
M7.1 (Auto-Scaling)       ┐
M7.2 (Cost Tiering)       ├── All parallel (independent features)
M7.3 (Anomaly Detection)  ┘
```

**Time Estimate:** 8 hours (all tasks parallelizable)

---

## The Three Tasks

### M7.1: Auto-Scaling Based on Metrics
**Witness:** RDS auto-scales t4g.small → m5.large at >500 writes/sec, zero manual intervention

### M7.2: Checkpoint Tiering Strategy
**Witness:** Cost reduction $3,680 → $126/month (96% savings via Redis hot + PostgreSQL cold)

### M7.3: Anomaly Detection
**Witness:** Alert fires when checkpoint >5MB or error rate >3σ above baseline

## Success Metrics

```yaml
M7_complete:
  auto_scaling: operational
  cost_reduction: >90%
  anomaly_detection: working
  production_mastery: achieved
```

---

## The Final State

**After M7:** Fully autonomous, cost-optimized, self-healing checkpoint persistence system.

**The 7 Phase Journey Complete:**
- M1: Foundation (SQLite)
- M2: Production Ready (Async + Blob externalization)
- M3: Migration Trigger (Metrics + Decision)
- M4: PostgreSQL Migration (IRREVERSIBLE)
- M5: Advanced Optimization (Performance)
- M6: Knowledge Sharing (Store)
- M7: Production Mastery (Autonomous)

**From zero to production mastery in 28 tasks.**
