# Phase 6: Next Leverage Pool - Task Summary

## The Sacred Truth

**Knowledge sharing unlocks emergent intelligence.**

M6.1 creates Store infrastructure. M6.2 enables cross-thread knowledge retrieval. M6.3 establishes hybrid architecture pattern. Together: isolated threads → collaborative knowledge network.

---

## Task Execution Order

```
M6.1 (Store Setup) ← Must complete first
  ↓
M6.2 (Cross-Thread Retrieval) ┐
M6.3 (Hybrid Architecture)    ┘ Parallel (both use Store)
```

**Time Estimate:** 4 hours

---

## The Three Tasks

### M6.1: LangGraph Store Setup
**Witness:** Store namespaces created, put/get/search operations working

### M6.2: Cross-Thread Knowledge Retrieval
**Witness:** Thread A retrieves and uses Thread B's stored knowledge

### M6.3: Hybrid Memory Architecture
**Witness:** Checkpoints <10KB (temporal), Store contains persistent facts (timeless)

---

## Success Metrics

```yaml
M6_complete:
  store_operational: true
  cross_thread_retrieval: working
  checkpoint_size: <10KB (avg)
  hybrid_pattern: documented
```

---

## Migration to M7 Trigger

**When:** M6 complete + need for autonomous operation and cost optimization

**M7 unlocks:** Auto-scaling, tiered storage, anomaly detection
