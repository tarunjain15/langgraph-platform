# Task R10.4: [Integration] Execution Channel

## The Constraint

**Before:** Actions execute without audit trail
**After:** Executor node logs all actions to execution channel (immutable audit log)

## The Witness

**Observable Truth:** Approved action executed → execution channel receives log entry with result, timestamp, agent_id

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ExecutorNode reads coordination_decision from coordination channel
- [x] Action execution produces side effect (file modified with validation tag)
- [x] execution_channel configured with Topic reducer (audit trail accumulates)
- [x] Log entry includes: agent_id, action, result (success/failure), timestamp, duration (1.20ms)
- [x] Failed executions also logged (no silent failures - exception handling implemented)

## Code Pattern

```python
class ExecutorNode:
    async def execute(self, state: ExecutionState) -> dict:
        decision = state.get("coordination_decision")
        if not decision:
            return {}

        start = time.time()
        try:
            result = await self.apply_action(decision["action"])
            status = "success"
        except Exception as e:
            result = str(e)
            status = "failure"

        return {
            "executions": [{
                "agent_id": decision["approved_agent_id"],
                "action": decision["action"],
                "result": result,
                "status": status,
                "timestamp": time.time(),
                "duration_ms": (time.time() - start) * 1000
            }]
        }
```

## Completion Signal

Action executed, logged to execution channel with timestamp and result status

## Notes

Topic channel critical - execution history must be complete (all actions logged).
