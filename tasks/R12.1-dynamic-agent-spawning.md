# Task R12.1: [Feature] Dynamic Agent Spawning

## The Constraint

**Before:** Workflow topology fixed at compile time
**After:** Agents spawn other agents dynamically at runtime

## The Witness

**Observable Truth:** Manager agent spawns specialist agent mid-execution, both coordinate via channels

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ManagerAgent.spawn_agent() creates new agent instance at runtime
- [ ] Spawned agent receives coordination channels (observation, intent, coordination, execution)
- [ ] Multiple agents coordinate without conflicts via 4-channel pattern
- [ ] Agents can self-terminate when task complete
- [ ] Agent count N scalable (not hardcoded)

## Code Pattern

```python
class ManagerAgent:
    async def coordinate(self):
        state = await self.observe()

        if self.needs_specialist(state):
            specialist = await self.spawn_agent(
                agent_type=SpecialistAgent,
                channels={
                    "observation": self.observation_channel,
                    "intent": self.intent_channel,
                    "coordination": self.coordination_channel,
                    "execution": self.execution_channel
                }
            )
            await specialist.start()
```

## Completion Signal

Manager spawns specialist, both write to intent channel, coordinator resolves, task completes

## Notes

Dynamic spawning enables adaptive workflows - complexity triggers specialist agents on demand
