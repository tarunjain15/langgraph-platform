# Task R12.2: [Feature] Event-Driven Coordination

## The Constraint

**Before:** Polling-based coordination (inefficient, high CPU)
**After:** Event-driven coordination (reactive, <100ms latency)

## The Witness

**Observable Truth:** File change triggers agent execution <100ms without polling loops

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Channels support pub/sub pattern (agents subscribe to topics)
- [ ] Agents subscribe to specific channel topics (e.g., "file_changes", "api_events")
- [ ] External event triggers agent execution <100ms
- [ ] NO polling loops in codebase (verify with code search)
- [ ] Agent wakes on event, processes, sleeps (not continuous loop)

## Code Pattern

```python
class Agent:
    async def subscribe_and_react(self):
        # Subscribe to observation channel
        async for event in self.observation_channel.subscribe("file_changes"):
            # Reactive execution (no polling)
            await self.process_event(event)
            # Agent sleeps until next event
```

## Completion Signal

File change triggers agent <100ms, no polling loops verified in codebase

## Notes

Event-driven is critical for scale - 1000 agents polling = CPU overload, 1000 agents subscribed = minimal overhead
